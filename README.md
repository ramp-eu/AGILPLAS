The Badges above demonstrate testing, code coverage
and commitment to coding standards (since the code is linted on commit).

The links need to be amended to point to the correct repo.

Sign up for:

- CI Test system - e.g. Travis
- A Documentation website - e.g. ReadTheDocs
- Static Code Analysis tool - e.g. Codacy
- CII Best Practices https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org

Only CII Best Practices (and its badge) is mandatory. Any equivalent public automated tools for the other three may be used.

Note that the CII Best Practices questionaire will request evidence of tooling used.

## Background

An M-DUINO PLC is a robust piece of hardware designed to work in industrial environments. It can read and write data through digital, relay and analog pins; and has an underlying programmable Arduino board. The repository contains the necessary firmware to program and control the device’s behaviour. This firmware is Arduino (C++) code.
