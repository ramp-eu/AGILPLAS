## Background

An M-DUINO PLC is a robust piece of hardware designed to work in industrial environments. It can read and write data through digital, relay and analog pins; and has an underlying programmable Arduino board. The repository contains the necessary firmware to program and control the device’s behaviour. This firmware is Arduino (C++) code.
